## Aishwarya H. Balwani

I am a PhD student in Electrical & Computer Engineering at [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu/), where I'm part of the [ML@GT](https://ml.gatech.edu/) and [GT Neuro](https://neuro.gatech.edu/) communities. I am fortunate to be advised by the wonderful [Dr. Eva Dyer](https://bme.gatech.edu/bme/faculty/Eva-Dyer), with whom I broadly work on adressing open questions in computational neuroscience using tools from applied mathematics, digital signal processing and machine learning.

While my research interests span many different areas, topics that I'm particularly interested in are:
- Sparse, low-rank and low-dimensional approximations of data
- Representation learning, and in particular, transferability, generalizability and interpretability of features in deep neural networks
- Explainability of artificial and biological neural networks
- Generative modeling

Outside of research, my hobbies include reading, music, racket sports and the rubik's cube along with its many variants. I am incredibly fond of cats, enjoy history of almost any kind, have been a Federer fan for far too long, and remain a Bombay kid at heart for life.
