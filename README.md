### About Me

I am a PhD student in <a href="https://www.ece.gatech.edu/" target="_blank">Electrical & Computer Engineering</a> at <a href="https://www.gatech.edu/" target="_blank">Georgia Tech</a>, where I'm a member of the <a href="https://dyerlab.gatech.edu/" target="_blank">NerDS Lab</a> as well as part of the larger <a href="https://ml.gatech.edu/" target="_blank">ML@GT</a> and <a href="https://neuro.gatech.edu/" target="_blank">GT Neuro</a> research communities. I have the privilege of being advised by <a href="https://bme.gatech.edu/bme/faculty/Eva-Dyer" target="_blank">Dr. Eva Dyer</a>, with whom I work on addressing open questions in computational neuroscience using tools from applied mathematics, digital signal processing and machine learning.

### Ongoing Research

Much of my current work revolves around and studies different aspects of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1206.5538" target="_blank">Representation Learning</a> with an eye towards  explaining complex, hierarchical information processing systems. In particular I look to leverage the geometric structure of representations found in both _artificial & biological_ neural networks so as to render them more interpretable, and thereby discover their governing principles.
Some ideas that I actively think about in these contexts are:
- Sparse, low-rank, and low-dimensional approximations of data.
- Disentangling of data manifolds, the quantification of representations that live on them, their evolution across space-time, and the changes that different perturbations bring about in them.
- The effects of regularization & architecture on representations learnt by neural networks.
- Generalizability and potential for transfer of representations across different tasks and domains.

My long-term goal is to use math & engineering to develop computational methods that effectively characterize changes in structure, organization, and information processing in the brain across different stages of neurological age, health, and development. I subsequently hope to employ these insights in the development of better ML/AI systems that require less supervision and/or data, learn progressively, and are more amenable to changes in task structure.
