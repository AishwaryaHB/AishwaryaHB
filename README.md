# Aishwarya H. Balwani

Hi! I'm a PhD student at Georgia Tech, where I'm a part of the School of Electrical & Computer Engineering and the Center for Machine Learning. I am lucky to be advised by the wonderful Dr. Eva Dyer, with whom I broadly work on adressing open questions in computational neuroscience using tools from applied mathematics, digital signal processing and machine learning.

While my research interests span many different areas, topics that I'm particularly interested in are:
- Sparse, low-rank and low-dimensional approximations of data
- Representation learning, and in particular, transferability, generalizability and interpretability of features in deep neural networks
- Analysis and explainability of artificial and biological neural networks
- Generative modeling

Outside of research, my hobbies include reading, music, racket sports and the rubik's cube along with its many variants. I am extremely fond of cats, enjoy history of almost any kind, have been a Federer fan for far too long, and will always be a Bom-BAE kid for life.
