### About Me

I am a PhD candidate in <a href="https://www.ece.gatech.edu/" target="_blank">Electrical & Computer Engineering</a> at <a href="https://www.gatech.edu/" target="_blank">Georgia Tech</a>, largely interested in addressing open questions in computational neuroscience using tools from applied mathematics, digital signal processing, and machine learning. I'm associated with the <a href="https://ml.gatech.edu/" target="_blank">ML@GT</a> and <a href="https://neuro.gatech.edu/" target="_blank">GT Neuro</a> research communities and have previously worked closely with <a href="https://bme.gatech.edu/bme/faculty/Eva-Dyer" target="_blank">Dr. Eva Dyer</a>.

### Ongoing Research

Much of my current work revolves around and studies different aspects of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1206.5538" target="_blank">Representation Learning</a> with an eye towards  explaining complex, hierarchical information processing systems. In particular I look to leverage the geometric structure of representations found in both _artificial & biological_ neural networks so as to render them more interpretable, and thereby discover their governing principles.
Some ideas that I actively think about in these contexts are:
- Sparse, low-rank, and low-dimensional approximations of data.
- Disentangling of data manifolds, the quantification of representations that live on them, their evolution across space-time, and the changes that different perturbations bring about in them.
- The effects of regularization & architecture on representations learnt by neural networks.
- Generalizability and potential for transfer of representations across different tasks and domains.

My long-term goal is to use math & engineering to develop computational methods that effectively characterize changes in structure, organization, and information processing in the brain across different stages of neurological age, health, and development. I subsequently hope to employ these insights in the development of better ML/AI systems that require less supervision and/or data, learn progressively, and are more amenable to changes in task structure.

### Interests & Hobbies

**Machine Learning:** Unsupervised/self-supervised learning, dimensionality reduction & manifold learning, generative models, metric/similarity learning, and learning with structured sparsity.<br>
**Mathematics:** Matrix & tensor decompositions, column subset selection, low-rank approximation, metric embeddings, convex geometry, optimization, group & representation theory, differential geometry & topology, and information geometry.<br>
**Neuroscience:** Neural coding & decoding, representational learning, models of brain structure & organization, and connectomics.

Outside of academic and scientific pursuits, my hobbies include reading, listening to (rather old) music, watching + playing racket sports, and solving the classic 3x3 Rubik's cube along with its many variants. I am incredibly fond of cats, enjoy history of almost any kind, have been a Federer fan for far too long, and remain a Bombay kid at heart for life.
