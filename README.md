Hi! I'm a PhD student in Electrical & Computer Engineering at Georgia Tech, where I'm a part of the NerDS Lab. My research interests lie at the intersection of Machine Learning, Mathematics, Computational Neuroscience and Digital Signal Processing.

Topics that I'm particularly interested in are:
- Sparse and low-dimensional representations of data
- Representation learning, and in particular, transferability, generalizability and interpretability of features in deep neural networks
- Analysis and explainability of artificial and biological neural networks
- Generative modeling
