Hi! I'm a PhD student at Georgia Tech, where I'm a part of the School of Electrical & Computer Engineering and the Center for Machine Learning. I am lucky to be advised by the wonderful Dr. Eva Dyer, with whom I broadly work on topics in computational neuroscience, applied mathematics, digital signal processing and machine learning.

While my research interests span many different areas, topics that I'm particularly interested in are:
- Sparse and low-dimensional representations of data
- Representation learning, and in particular, transferability, generalizability and interpretability of features in deep neural networks
- Analysis and explainability of artificial and biological neural networks using tools from information geometry and linear algebra
- Generative modeling

Outside of research, my hobbies include reading, music, racket sports and the rubik's cube along with its many variants.
