## Aishwarya H. Balwani

I am a PhD student in Electrical & Computer Engineering at [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu/), where I'm a member of the [NerDS Lab](https://dyerlab.gatech.edu/) as well as a part of the larger [ML@GT](https://ml.gatech.edu/) and [GT Neuro](https://neuro.gatech.edu/) research communities. I am fortunate to be advised by [Dr. Eva Dyer](https://bme.gatech.edu/bme/faculty/Eva-Dyer), with whom I work on addressing open questions in computational neuroscience using tools from applied mathematics, digital signal processing and machine learning.

Much of my current work revolves around and studies different aspects of [Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1206.5538).
Some ideas that I'm actively thinking about in this context are:
- Sparse, low-rank and low-dimensional approximations of data.
- Quantifying features in deep neural networks for the purposes of transfer, generalization and interpretability.
- The effect of regularization and architecture on features learnt by deep neural networks.
- Explainability of artificial and biological neural networks.
- Multi-task/transfer/meta learning and domain adaptation.

My long-term goal is to use math and engineering to better understand information processing in the brain, and to employ these insights in the development of better ML/AI systems that require less supervision and data, learn progressively, and are more amenable to changes in task structure.

Topics of scientific study that I'm excited about in general include unsupervised/self-supervised learning, dimensionality reduction, tensor decompositions, metric learning, generative models, convex geometry, optimization, harmonic analysis and information geometry.

Outside of academic and technical pursuits, my hobbies include reading, music, racket sports and the rubik's cube along with its many variants. I am incredibly fond of cats, enjoy history of almost any kind, have been a Federer fan for far too long, and remain a Bombay kid at heart for life.
