### About Me

I am a PhD student in Electrical & Computer Engineering at [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu/), where I'm a member of the [NerDS Lab](https://dyerlab.gatech.edu/) as well as a part of the larger [ML@GT](https://ml.gatech.edu/) and [GT Neuro](https://neuro.gatech.edu/) research communities. I am fortunate to be advised by [Dr. Eva Dyer](https://bme.gatech.edu/bme/faculty/Eva-Dyer), with whom I work on addressing open questions in computational neuroscience using tools from applied mathematics, digital signal processing and machine learning.

### Ongoing Research

Much of my current work revolves around and studies different aspects of [Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1206.5538).
Some ideas that I'm actively thinking about in this context are:
- Sparse, low-rank and low-dimensional approximations of data.
- Quantifying features in deep neural networks for the purposes of transfer, generalization & interpretability.
- The evolution of features in deep neural networks across space-time.
- The effect of regularization & architecture on features learnt by deep neural networks.
- Explainability of artificial & biological neural networks.
- Multi-task/transfer/meta learning & domain adaptation.

My long-term goal is to use math and engineering to better understand information processing in the brain, and to employ these insights in the development of better ML/AI systems that require less supervision and data, learn progressively, and are more amenable to changes in task structure.

### Interests & Hobbies

**Machine Learning:** Unsupervised/self-supervised learning, dimensionality reduction, generative models, metric/similarity learning and learning with structured sparsity.<br>
**Mathematics:** Matrix & tensor decompositions, metric embeddings, convex geometry, optimization, harmonic analysis, (discrete) differential geometry and information geometry.<br>
**Neuroscience:** Neural coding and decoding, representational learning, models of brain structure & organization and connectomics.

Outside of academic and scientific pursuits, my hobbies include reading, music, racket sports and the rubik's cube along with its many variants. I am incredibly fond of cats, enjoy history of almost any kind, have been a Federer fan for far too long, and remain a Bombay kid at heart for life.
