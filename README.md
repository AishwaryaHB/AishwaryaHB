### About Me

I am a PhD student in <a href="https://www.ece.gatech.edu/" target="_blank">Electrical & Computer Engineering</a> at <a href="https://www.gatech.edu/" target="_blank">Georgia Tech</a>, where I'm a member of the <a href="https://dyerlab.gatech.edu/" target="_blank">NerDS Lab</a> as well as a part of the larger <a href="https://ml.gatech.edu/" target="_blank">ML@GT</a> and <a href="https://neuro.gatech.edu/" target="_blank">GT Neuro</a> research communities. I have the privilege of being advised by <a href="https://bme.gatech.edu/bme/faculty/Eva-Dyer" target="_blank">Dr. Eva Dyer</a>, with whom I work on addressing open questions in computational neuroscience using tools from applied mathematics, digital signal processing and machine learning.

### Ongoing Research

Much of my current work revolves around and studies different aspects of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1206.5538" target="_blank">Representation Learning</a>.
Some ideas that I'm actively thinking about in this context are:
- Sparse, low-rank and low-dimensional approximations of data.
- Quantifying features in deep neural networks for the purposes of transfer, generalization & interpretability.
- The evolution of features in deep neural networks across space-time.
- The effect of regularization & architecture on features learnt by deep neural networks.
- Explainability of artificial & biological neural networks.
- Multi-task/transfer/meta learning & domain adaptation.

My long-term goal is to use math & engineering to better understand information processing in the brain, and to employ these insights in the development of better ML/AI systems that require less supervision & data, learn progressively, and are more amenable to changes in task structure.

### Interests & Hobbies

**Machine Learning:** Unsupervised/self-supervised learning, dimensionality reduction & manifold learning, generative models, metric/similarity learning, and learning with structured sparsity.<br>
**Mathematics:** Matrix & tensor decompositions, column subset selection, low-rank approximation, metric embeddings, convex geometry, optimization, harmonic analysis, (discrete) differential geometry, and information geometry.<br>
**Neuroscience:** Neural coding & decoding, representational learning, models of brain structure & organization, and connectomics.

Outside of academic and scientific pursuits, my hobbies include reading, music, racket sports and the rubik's cube along with its many variants. I am incredibly fond of cats, enjoy history of almost any kind, have been a Federer fan for far too long, and remain a Bombay kid at heart for life.
